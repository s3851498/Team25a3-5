														<h2>Comparing Test Results</h2> </header> <p>Our team’s
															results share common trends in introversion but is
															otherwise varied in both tests of choice and outcomes.
															There are strong suggestions that our team could be
															divided halfway regarding their choices of action when
															it comes to working as team, but with an agreement on
															disciplined organisation and healthy communication, we
															have not found ourselves challenged by different
															personalities coming together. </br>Regardless of seeing
															our different traits, the team has learned to come
															together in a short timeframe in order to accomplish our
															goals. </p> <ul class="actions"> <li><a

																</header> <p>Like our personality tests, our ideal jobs
																	showed variety in the directions we were hoping to take
																	within the industry.</br> Notably, Samuel’s career
																	choice had the most physicality in the group as a
																	technician, as opposed to the rest of the team directed
																	more towards handling digital information. Caden, Niki, and Samuel targeted smaller firms or
																	recruiting agencies and Debborah chose a recruiting
																	agency. We felt that while Niki, Jake, and Caden all
																	were interested in software, the directions they wanted
																	to take their skills were different from each
																	other.</br> Our conclusion was that we were still early
																	into deciding our careers and found each other’s choices
																	intriguing. In the end, we decided we were still open
																	minded to what the future may bring. </p> <ul
