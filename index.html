													<h2>Comparing Test Results</h2> </header> <p>Our team’s
															results share common trends in introversion but is
															otherwise varied in both tests of choice and outcomes.
															There are strong suggestions that our team could be
															divided halfway regarding their choices of action when
															it comes to working as team, but with an agreement on
															disciplined organisation and healthy communication, we
															have not found ourselves challenged by different
															personalities coming together. </br>Regardless of seeing
															our different traits, the team has learned to come
															together in a short timeframe in order to accomplish our
															goals. </p> <ul class="actions"> <li><a

																</header> <p>It appeared that most of us had a vision of working contractually after achieving our degrees. We shared sentiments of the nature of what the IT industry was like in terms of employment, and for the most part agreed that 
												building a portfolio of our own as contractors would yield more success in finding secure employment.</br>
We all valued flexibility as part of our career plans, lockdown status notwithstanding. Our individual lifestyles appreciated the idea of having our careers work around our personal lives, be it family, ulterior goals, or simply to have more time to enjoy hobbies (which luckily could coincide with some of our careers anyway!).</br>
There were unique aspects in each of our goals: Niki was prioritising the flexibility to spend more time with his family; Debborah was the only one whose plan was strictly aimed at employment with a company and not pursue contracts; Samuel shows more interest in the physicality of the IT industry over the digital; 
and Caden has set his goals for higher, more demanding positions.</br>
It is surprising to us how different and similar our goals were at the same time and emphasised how vast the industry was. We also deduced there was great potential to diversify our plans as we discovered more about the field. However, we all agreed that studying has helped us plot our paths more accurately, and are eager to see where we’ll be in another three years.
