																<p></p> </section> My career plans are to finish university with either a degree in computer science or information technology, from there I want to be able to work as a contractor for software development so that I can be my boss and work from home. After earning enough money and skills,
													I would like to start my own business in the software development world.</br>
If I can start up as a contractor I would find a reasonable business to work for, one that I would find enjoyable to do development for and that pays pretty decently, I would join the company as high of a position that they would offer me and try to work my way up so that one day I would be able to run my own business.

																		<p></p> </section> My career plan is to become qualified and accredited to be able to use data analysis software, data entry, data visualisation, MS excel and other programs. I will also work towards certification in programming languages such as Python, SQL, Oracle etc. I will also need to do a mathematics course to refresh my knowledge. I would really like to work in medical research or social health setting.</br>
For the next 3 years I will work towards a degree in Data science or data analysis as well as a degree in Information Technology, so I can have flexible work options such as working remotely or onsite. I would also like to work or volunteer for charities in a business analysis role, which would require a certificate or degree in business analysis.

																					<p></p> </section> Right now, my hope is to find a flexible working life in the future. While I do plan on entering the industry within an established company (preferably working as a programmer/developer but my working history gives me plenty of options), I intend to build a strong portfolio with independent projects and take a stab at working as a freelancer/indie from home. Honestly, I just want to spend more time with my partner and daughter, and my plans are always open to change with that in mind.

																					</div> <p></p> </section> My career plan is to get a degree in information technology so that I can eventually get a job as a computer technician. I’m not sure where exactly I would want to work but I’d like to work on a variety of PC’s and systems so being a contractor sounds good for what I want to do. I don’t have any experience, so I’d probably need to start in a different position than I want. From there I would learn as I work to become qualified enough to join a bigger company or maybe start my own.
